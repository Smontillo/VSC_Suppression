# VSC Suppression

*Update* $\Longrightarrow$ *July 11, 2024*

Open source code and data for the recent paper **"Theory of Resonant Suppression in Vibrational Polariton Chemistry"**.

Check $\Rightarrow$ https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/6645505f418a5379b064c02e.

Folders of Fig. 1 to Fig 4. contain the input files used for the HEOM simulations, the partial output data files, and the scripts to extract and plot the images presented in the paper. Also, these Input files output the data for Fig S1 to Fig S3.

Images that make use of the Effective Spectral Density (Presented in Supplementary Note 5 fo the SI) and the Fermi's Golden Rule (Equation 13 to Equation 15 of the main text) contain the code for calculating the respective properties in the plotting files.
